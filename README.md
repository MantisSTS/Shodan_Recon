# Shodan_Recon

Takes a set of IPs and performs recon to get domain names associated with the IP. Especially useful for when there is no reverse-dns record set.

## Why?

There are lots of times in a bug-bounty or a red-team pentest that you may be given a load of external IP ranges and you may want to investigate the web applications hosted on the servers. 

Sometimes the IP address will not directly resolve to the web app and may require a domain name. That is where this tool may come in handy, especially when there is no PTR (Reverse DNS) record.
